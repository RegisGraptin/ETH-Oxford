## Technical Implementation

We are using Aleph Zero to store medical records of patients. We decided to build on top of Aleph Zero as the Privacy Engine will be released soon, allowing us to have fully privacy over the data.

## Roadmap

At the moment, we will have a record for all users. New records can only be added by the user. But we could imagine in the future a consortium of doctors allows to update and add new medical records. 

Decide to segment the information or to share only partial to it. If you have an injury on the foot, you may want to choose which information you want to share, maybe not your dental data.

Physical token allowing you to access your medical data. On an emergency, we know the blood card, allowing you to know your blood type, when you do not know it or enable to share it. It is the same system, on an emergency, where medical people can scan your token and have access to your medical information.
