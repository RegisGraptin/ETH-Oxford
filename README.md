# ETH Oxford - Health Book

Securely trace your medical life records by empowering blockchain technology. Store your records on-chain and keep ownership and control over your data. Grant access to trusted healthcare providers, putting you in control of your healthcare journey.


Easily share your medical records to the medical team. Grant access and keep control over your data. No need to worries about explaining in detail all the previous information you had to share with your doctor. 


Always have your medical record up to date

When changing of doctors, the new one will not know about all the past medical records you have. It can be difficult for him to know all the things you have encounter and also for you, who may not have the technical language to explain to him all the disease you have. We want to simplify that. From the patient, it simplifies the process, no need to prepare the list of all the medecines, or all the allergen you have, it is on-chain. And for the doctor, it is easier, he can have a better understanding of who you are see you current treatment.



## Technical Implementation

We are using Aleph Zero to store medical records of patients. We decided to build on top of Aleph Zero as the Privacy Engine will be released soon, allowing us to have fully privacy over the data.

## Roadmap

At the moment, we will have a record for all users. New records can only be added by the user. But we could imagine in the future a consortium of doctors allows to update and add new medical records. 

Decide to segment the information or to share only partial to it. If you have an injury on the foot, you may want to choose which information you want to share, maybe not your dental data.

Physical token allowing you to access your medical data. On an emergency, we know the blood card, allowing you to know your blood type, when you do not know it or enable to share it. It is the same system, on an emergency, where medical people can scan your token and have access to your medical information.
