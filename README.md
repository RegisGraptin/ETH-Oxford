## Technical Implementation

We have use the `ink!athon` boilerplate to structure the project organization for the smart contract and front end.
Contract information can be found in `inkathon/contract/`.



## Roadmap

At the moment, we have a list of records for all users. New records can only be added by the user. But we could imagine in the future a consortium of doctors that are allow to update or add new medical records after an appoitment or medical opperation. 

Another point to think would be to let the user the possibility to segment their medical data and choose which information to share with different parties. For example, individuals may want to share only relevant information related to a specific injury or condition while keeping other details private. This granular control empowers users to manage their privacy preferences according to their unique needs and preferences.

Finally, in response to critical situations where immediate access to medical information can be life-saving, we are thinking to introduce physical token designed to provide seamless emergency access to user data. Similar to a blood type card, this token can be scan enabling you to get access to your medical information in case of  emergencies. Whether it's an unexpected accident or a sudden medical crisis, this physical token ensure that vital information is immediately available, enabling rapid and informed decision-making by healthcare professionals.
